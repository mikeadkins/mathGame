I created this as a way to begin learning Python with a pratical example. I have a daughter that has trouble with her multiplication in school. The program asks for responses to random multiplication questions. If a question is answered wrong it simply asks the user to try again with the same question. If answered correctly it congratulates and moves to the next question. After five correct answers it gives a four digit code to give to the parents. The parents could then choose the reward. This is the first program I have ever created and I know it needs some help. I am looking to use a graphical interface for it in the future and get away from the command line only interface that it currently has. But I still have to learn how to do that.
